# Flight Prediction Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of flight data using Python to gain insights and prepare for predictive modeling.

## Tech Stack

**Language:** Python

**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Data Overview

The flight dataset contains information about flights, including departure and arrival times, airlines, airports, and delays.

## Analysis

### Data Exploration

- Summary statistics
- Data types and missing values
- Distribution of variables

### Visualization

- Distribution plots
- Correlation matrix
- Time series analysis
- Geospatial analysis (if applicable)

### Feature Engineering

- Extracting date and time features
- Creating new features from existing variables

### Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features (if applicable)

## Key Insights

- Busiest airports and airlines
- Time and seasonality patterns
- Factors affecting flight delays
- Correlation between variables

## Conclusion

The EDA process provides valuable insights into the flight dataset, which can be used for feature selection, predictive modeling, and making informed decisions.
